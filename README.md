# Hands-on-UI-UX-Experiments
## AIM
To understand and apply the fundamentals of UI and UX design, differentiate between UI and UX through real-world case studies, explore their interrelation in product design, and demonstrate the use of modern UI/UX design tools.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Many students and aspiring designers struggle to distinguish between UI and UX, and lack practical exposure to how design tools function. This experiment addresses these issues through hands-on activities and tool-based exploration, enabling learners to grasp the theory and practice of effective user-centered design.

## DESIGN STEPS
1. Explore the Fundamentals of UI and UX
Define UI (User Interface): layout, typography, colors, visual design
Define UX (User Experience): flow, usability, information architecture
Compare UI and UX roles in a project lifecycle
List key principles for effective design

2. Differentiate Between UI and UX Using Real-World Case Studies
• Case Study 1 (Good UI, Poor UX)
Example: A visually appealing e-commerce app with confusing checkout flow

• Case Study 2 (Poor UI, Good UX)
Example: Craigslist – outdated visuals but highly functional

Analyze:

• User goals
• Flow clarity
• Design feedback
• Accessibility and consistency

3. Illustrate the Relationship Between UI and UX in Design
• Develop a flow showing:
   ৹ User research → Empathy map → Wireframes → UI screens
• Highlight how UX informs layout decisions
• Use simple feature (e.g., Login form) to demonstrate UX to UI evolution

4. Demonstrate Various UI/UX Design Tools
• Figma: Collaborative design, prototyping, components
• Balsamiq: Low-fidelity wireframing
• Adobe XD: High-fidelity design and interaction
• For each tool:
    ৹ Provide screenshots
    ৹ Explain use cases
    ৹ Create a small sample project

## Results:
The experiment helped distinguish between UI and UX clearly through case studies. Students successfully understood how UX flows guide UI design. Hands-on exposure to tools like Figma and Balsamiq enhanced practical skills and design awareness.

## CONCLUSION
The experiment achieved its objective of bridging theoretical understanding and practical application in UI/UX design. Students were able to identify UI/UX elements, analyze case studies, and use modern tools to prototype simple user interfaces. The integration of theory and tools builds a strong foundation for user-centered design practices.
